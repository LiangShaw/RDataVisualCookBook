This is a reference e-book on ggplot2 originally written in "R Graphics Cookbook".

Here are the source jupyter notebooks.

If you wanna look for some ggplot2 skills quickly, please step to my blogs [RDataVisualization-1](https://liangshaw.github.io/2022/01/02/RDataVisualization-1/) and [RDataVisualization-2](https://liangshaw.github.io/2022/01/02/RDataVisualization-2/), which have navigation bars.

Thanks for your like!
